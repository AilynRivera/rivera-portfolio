# My Portfolio Website

## About Me
I'm a 3rd-year student who enjoys coding almost as much as I enjoy online games and binge-reading random articles at 2 AM. When I'm not debugging my code (or my life), you'll probably find me in a ranked match or deep in a plot twist. I build websites that are clean, user-friendly, and hopefully don’t crash like my game when the Wi-Fi drops.

##Reflection

### What UI/UX principles did you apply and why?
I focused on simplicity and consistency to make the site easy to navigate. I used clear headings and organized content in a logical flow to improve usability. Mobile responsiveness was also a priority so users could view the site on any device.

### What challenges did you face and how did you solve them?
I had trouble getting GitHub Pages to display correctly due to a broken path in my links. After checking GitHub documentation, I realized I needed to use relative paths and commit changes properly. I also had layout issues.
### How would you improve the portfolio next?
I’d like to add animations, improve accessibility with ARIA labels, and build a contact form with backend integration. I also plan to include more detailed project pages.
